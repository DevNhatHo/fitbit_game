This is not a finished game yet, watch this repository to see how it progresses or make your own version.

>> I'm creating a fitbit game where while you level the animal you chose levels up as well.
>> It changes images at certain levels to imitate it growing. Uses steps for level up.

>> At level 5 the egg hatches.
>> From then on it will grow by every so levels.
>> Player gets 1 level per 5.000 steps.
>> Possible to get 2-3 levels for a normal activity player if 10.000 steps a day is the goal.
